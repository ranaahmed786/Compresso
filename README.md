# 📦 Compresso

**Compresso** is a modern, cross-platform, folder-based compression and decompression tool built using **Qt Widgets (C++)**. It uses **Canonical Huffman Coding** to efficiently compress files while maintaining directory structure. Designed with end-users in mind, Compresso provides a clean UI, fast multithreaded performance, and strong error handling.

## 🔍 About the Project

Compresso solves the need for a dedicated, efficient **folder compression utility** with a clean UI and powerful performance.

Unlike generic file compressors (ZIP/RAR), Compresso:
- Compresses each file **individually** using **Canonical Huffman Codes**
- Preserves complete folder structure
- Optimizes binary storage with minimal header overhead

Key benefits:
- 🚀 Multithreaded operations
- 📊 Real-time progress feedback
- 🔄 Lossless recovery of original structure
- 🖥️ Intuitive interface for all users

Perfect for:
- Educational projects
- Custom data archival
- Filesystem optimization experiments

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Compression Process
1. User selects folder via GUI
2. Files are tokenized and frequency-analyzed
3. Huffman Tree → Canonical Huffman Codes
4. Encoded content saved as `.compresso` files
5. Output in `[OriginalName] (Compressed)` folder

### Decompression Process
1. User selects `(Compressed)` folder
2. Rebuilds canonical codebook
3. Decodes bitstreams to original files
4. Restores to `[OriginalName] (Decompressed)`

---

## 🧰 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Qt 5/6
- C++17
- Qt Creator (recommended)
- Git

### Build Instructions
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/compresso.git
cd compresso
# Qt Creator:
open Compresso.pro
# OR manual build:
qmake Compresso.pro
make
```

## 🧪 Usage Guide

### 📤 Compress a Folder

1. Launch **Compresso**.
2. Click **Browse Folder** and select any folder.
3. Press **Compress**.
4. Output is saved in `[YourFolder] (Compressed)/`.

### 📥 Decompress a Folder

1. Select a folder ending in `(Compressed)`.
2. Click **Decompress**.
3. Original files are restored in `[FolderName] (Decompressed)/`.

### ❗ Important Notes

- Only folders ending in `(Compressed)` are accepted for decompression.
- Compressed files use the `.compresso` extension.
- Nested folders are supported and recreated exactly.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- 🚫 Only compresses **folders**, not individual files.
- ⚠️ Cannot decompress folders not generated by **Compresso**.
- 🔒 No password protection or encryption.
- 🐢 Large files may take longer due to bit-level operations.
